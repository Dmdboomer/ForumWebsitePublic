 -> Then you can create children nodes which will split up the direction of the discussion
-> If you believe that at a certain point, you are able to prove the original statement, leave an "Attempt to Prove" comment
-> After enough endorsements (See below), the node will be marked as "Completed" and will contribute to the scoring algorithms (See below)
This process is not opinion based. Everyone should theoretically come to the same conclusion on all nodes. 
Please try to be objective`
